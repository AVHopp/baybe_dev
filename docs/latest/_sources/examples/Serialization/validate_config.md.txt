# Example for validation of a config file

This example shows how to load and validate a user defined configuration file.
We use the two configuration dictionaries.
The first one represents a valid configuration, the second does not.

## Necessary imports


```python
from cattrs import ClassValidationError
```


```python
from baybe import Campaign
```

## Defining config dictionaries

Note that the following explicit call `str()` is not strictly necessary.
It is included since our method of converting this example to a markdown file does not
interpret this part of the code as `python` code if we do not include this call.


```python
CONFIG = str(

## Verification of the two dictionaries

The first validation should work.


```python
Campaign.validate_config(CONFIG)
print("The first config seems valid.")
```

    The first config seems valid.

This should fail.


```python
try:
    Campaign.validate_config(INVALID_CONFIG)
    campaign = Campaign.from_config(INVALID_CONFIG)
except ClassValidationError:
    print("Something is wrong with the second config, which is what we expected!")
```

    Something is wrong with the second config, which is what we expected!
